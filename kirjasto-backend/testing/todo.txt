Books:
  - generate book_ids in ascending order.
  - remove description field.
  - have non string values in non string places in documents. Example: boolean should be a boolean not a string "false"

Comments:
  - Have comments be linked to the book they were commenting on.
  - Have comments be linked to the user_id they were commented under.

Users:
  - Users should have ids that are bigger than for example 10000+ so it wont collide with book_ids.
  - Users should have relationships between comments and ratings.

Ratings:
  - Ratings should be only posted to the book collection as mean score. So the conversion would be done before posting it there.
    - post score -> go to mean score -> convert -> post to database.
    Add the scores of all the people who took the test.
    Divide that total by the number of people.
    Add a field to the db that counts the time people have posted ratings.
    Constantly add onto both values with each posted rating
    
    post rating -> count +=1 score += score -> get count, score -> mean = score / count -> post mean


Authentication:
  - Users should have roles
  - Start from simple authentication and build up on it.
